# DecentralChain SDK — Security Audit Report

**Audit date:** March 20, 2026
**Auditor:** Platform Engineering (internal)
**Scope:** Full monorepo — 22 SDK packages + 3 apps (cubensis-connect, exchange, scanner)
**Methodology:** OWASP Top 10 (2021), NIST SP 800-132, CWE Top 25, GHSA advisory database
**Standard:** *Would you trust this code with your own money?*

---

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Disposition |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | 1 | Open — requires immediate remediation before any production release |
| HIGH | 3 | Open — fix before release |
| MEDIUM | 4 | Open — fix in current sprint |
| LOW | 3 | Tracked |
| INFO | 2 | Noted |

**Bottom line:** The monorepo is in materially better shape than it was before the DCC-115 epic. The Cognito/wx removal eliminated the highest-risk third-party supply chain. However, **one CRITICAL finding remains open**: the vault KDF (key derivation function) is built on MD5, a cryptographically broken algorithm, which puts user seed phrases at risk if an attacker obtains the vault blob.

---

## Phase A — Dependency & Supply Chain

### A-1 · Vulnerability Scan (`pnpm audit`)

**Status: 2 findings, both in dev dependencies**

| Severity | Package | Advisory | Path |
|----------|---------|----------|------|
| HIGH | `fast-xml-parser <=5.5.5` | GHSA-8gc5-j5rx-235r — numeric entity expansion bypass (incomplete fix for CVE-2026-26278) | `cubensis-connect` → `webdriverio` → `@wdio/utils` → `edgedriver` |
| MODERATE | `fast-xml-parser <=5.5.6` | GHSA-jp2q-39xq-3w4g — entity expansion limits bypassed on falsy zero | same path |

**Assessment:** Both vulnerabilities are in a test-tooling transitive dependency (`webdriverio`/`edgedriver`). These two packages do NOT ship in production extension bundles. The production attack surface is zero for these findings.

**Recommended action (LOW):** Upgrade `webdriverio` to resolve `fast-xml-parser >= 5.5.7` in its dependency tree, or add a `pnpm.overrides` pin. Track as P3.

### A-2 · Waves / Keeper Supply Chain

**Status: CLEAN**

```
grep -r "keeper-wallet|waves.exchange|cognito|IdentityController|amazon-cognito" \
  apps/cubensis-connect/src/ → 0 matches
```

DCC-118 (refactor) and DCC-117 (dependency removal) fully excised all Cognito and `@keeper-wallet/*` references. No residual supply-chain dependency.

### A-3 · Package Ownership Baseline

- All 22 SDK packages published under `@decentralchain/*` — owned by the Decentral-America org.
- 5 packages still tagged `@next` on npm (`assets-pairs-order`, `marshall`, `node-api-js`, `signer`, `signature-adapter`) — dist-tag promotion still pending (P1, tracked in STATUS.md).
- No `file:` or `link:` protocol deps in any published package.

---

## Phase B — Static Code Analysis

### B-1 · Biome Lint

**Status: CLEAN** — `pnpm nx run cubensis-connect:biome-lint` → 0 errors, 472 files checked.

### B-2 · Dangerous Patterns

| Pattern | Occurrences | Assessment |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `eval` / `Function(` | 0 | Clean |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | 1 | Justified — `highlight.tsx` uses Prism which only outputs escaped HTML tokens. `biome-ignore` comment present and documented. |
| `innerHTML =` | 0 | Clean |
| `document.write` | 0 | Clean |
| `Math.random()` | 0 (in crypto paths) | Clean — `ConfirmBackup.tsx` comment explicitly documents Fisher-Yates shuffle uses CSPRNG |
| `new RegExp(userInput)` | 1 | Safe — `remoteConfig.ts` line 124 escapes input via `escapeRegExp()` using the RFC-standard character class `[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]` before construction |
| `child_process` / `exec` / `spawn` | 0 | Clean |
| `http://` (insecure transport) | 0 | Clean — all production URLs are HTTPS |

### B-3 · TypeScript Safety Suppressions

| Suppression | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| `@ts-ignore` | 0 |
| `@ts-nocheck` | 0 |
| `@ts-expect-error` | 4 (in `PermissionsSettings.tsx`, `idle.ts`) |
| `as any` (non-trivial) | 30 |

The 4 `@ts-expect-error` suppressions are for documented Redux `connect()` + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` incompatibilities and a Chrome idle API type gap — pre-existing, justified. The 30 `as any` usages are spread across controllers and UI components, the most security-sensitive being in `VaultController.ts` (migration path, lines 63–70). Not an immediate exploit path, but reduces type-system safety net.

**Recommended action (MEDIUM):** Audit and narrow the `as any` casts in `VaultController.ts`, `permissions.ts`, and `message.ts` to typed alternatives. Track as DCC-backlog.

---

## Phase C — Security-Sensitive Code Review

---

### C-1 · ⚠️ CRITICAL — MD5-Based Key Derivation Function (KDF)

**File:** `packages/crypto/src/deriveSeedEncryptionKey.ts`
**CWE:** CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)
**OWASP:** A02:2021 — Cryptographic Failures
**References:** Wang et al., "How to Break MD5 and Other Hash Functions", CRYPTO 2004; NIST SP 800-132 (PBKDF2); RFC 7914 (scrypt); RFC 9106 (Argon2)

**Description:**

The vault encryption key and IV are derived from the user's password using MD5:

```typescript
// deriveSeedEncryptionKey.ts
const part1 = wasm.md5(Uint8Array.of(...hashedPasswordBytes, ...salt));
const part2 = wasm.md5(Uint8Array.of(...part1, ...hashedPasswordBytes, ...salt));
const key = Uint8Array.of(...part1, ...part2); // 32-byte AES key from MD5
const iv  = wasm.md5(Uint8Array.of(...part2, ...hashedPasswordBytes, ...salt));
```

The password pre-conditioning uses 5,000 iterations of SHA-256, but the output is hex-encoded as an ASCII string before each re-hash — this is not a standard KDF iteration; it produces a 64-byte ASCII string per round rather than operating on binary output, wasting entropy and providing weaker work-factor than equivalent SHA-256 binary iteration.

**Why this is CRITICAL:**

1. **MD5 is cryptographically broken.** Collision attacks are well-documented since 2004± (Wang 2004). MD5's 128-bit output space and lack of collision resistance make it unsuitable for any security-critical derivation.
2. **AES-CBC without authentication.** AES-CBC provides confidentiality but no integrity. Without a MAC, the ciphertext is malleable and vulnerable to padding oracle attacks (NIST SP 800-38A recommends AEAD for data with integrity requirements). An attacker who can modify the vault blob could trigger a padding oracle.
3. **5,000 SHA-256 iterations is far below modern KDF work factors.** NIST SP 800-132 recommends PBKDF2 with ≥ 600,000 iterations (SHA-256); Argon2id (RFC 9106) with memory cost ≥ 64 MiB; scrypt (RFC 7914) with N ≥ 32768, r = 8, p = 1. A GPU can compute ~10 billion MD5/s — even with 5,000 SHA-256 pre-rounds, the final MD5-based key is trivially brutable against a stolen vault blob.
4. **Salt is only 8 bytes (64 bits).** NIST SP 800-132 recommends a minimum 128-bit (16-byte) salt for password-based key derivation.

**Recommended remediation:**

Replace `deriveSeedEncryptionKey.ts` with PBKDF2 (Web Crypto API native):

```typescript
// Recommended replacement pattern
async function deriveSeedEncryptionKey(
  password: Uint8Array,
  salt: Uint8Array, // 16 bytes minimum
): Promise<[CryptoKey, Uint8Array]> {
  const baseKey = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw', password, 'PBKDF2', false, ['deriveKey'],
  );
  const key = await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
    { name: 'PBKDF2', hash: 'SHA-256', salt, iterations: 600_000 },
    baseKey,
    { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
    false,
    ['encrypt', 'decrypt'],
  );
  return key; // Use AES-GCM, not AES-CBC
}
```

**Upgrade path note:** Changing the KDF requires a one-time vault re-encryption migration on the next unlock (old password → decrypt with old KDF → re-encrypt with new KDF). This is standard practice (MetaMask, 1Password). Must be gated behind a migration version flag in `migrations.ts`.

---

### C-2 · HIGH — Production nginx Config Not Hardened (`docker/nginx/default.conf`)

**File:** `apps/exchange/docker/nginx/default.conf`
**OWASP:** A05:2021 — Security Misconfiguration
**References:** OWASP Secure Headers Project; MDN Content-Security-Policy; HSTS RFC 6797

**Description:**

DCC-141 hardened `apps/exchange/nginx.conf` (used by `Dockerfile`). However, the **production multi-network** config at `apps/exchange/docker/nginx/default.conf` — used by `Dockerfile.production` — was not updated and retains:

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains" always; # 30 days, no preload
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";  # Wildcard CORS
# No Content-Security-Policy header
# No X-Frame-Options (not present)
```

`Dockerfile.production` also runs as root (`nginx` image default, no `USER nginx` directive).

**Recommended remediation:** Apply identical mitigations as DCC-141 to `docker/nginx/default.conf` and `Dockerfile.production`.

---

### C-3 · HIGH — Plaintext Password in `browser.storage.session`

**File:** `apps/cubensis-connect/src/storage/storage.ts` (line 94–96), `apps/cubensis-connect/src/controllers/wallet.ts` (line 171)
**CWE:** CWE-256 (Unprotected Storage of Credentials)
**References:** Chrome Extension Security Guide; MDN `browser.storage.session`; OWASP A02:2021

**Description:**

The vault unlock password is persisted verbatim in `browser.storage.session`:

```typescript
export interface StorageSessionState {
  password?: string | null | undefined; // cleartext unlock password
}
// ...
this.#setSession({ password }); // written on every unlock
```

`browser.storage.session` is an MV3 API designed precisely for this use case (persisting state across service-worker restarts without surviving browser restart). It is not accessible to content scripts or web pages. However:

1. The cleartext password would appear in a memory dump of the browser process.
2. If a future extension vulnerability allowed arbitrary storage access, the password would be directly recoverable.
3. The preferred pattern is to store a **derived session key** (HKDF-derived from password + session nonce), not the raw password, so that session compromise cannot be replayed for vault decryption.

**Recommended remediation (Medium-term):** Derive a session key using HKDF after unlock; store the session key (not password) in `browser.storage.session`. Vault decryption still uses the full KDF from the password — only the auto-unlock shortcut uses the session key.

---

### C-4 · HIGH — Stale Build Artifacts: `host_permissions` Missing in Built Manifests

**Files:** `apps/cubensis-connect/dist/*/manifest.json`
**References:** Chrome Web Store policy; DCC-116

**Description:**

DCC-116 added `host_permissions: ['http://*/*', 'https://*/*']` to `adaptManifestToPlatform.js`. However, the currently committed `dist/` artifacts still show `host_permissions: []` because no rebuild has been run since the source change. The manifests in `dist/` are stale:

```
chrome/manifest.json:  host_permissions: []   # ← should be ['http://*/*', 'https://*/*']
edge/manifest.json:    host_permissions: []
firefox/manifest.json: host_permissions: []    (MV2 — irrelevant)
opera/manifest.json:   host_permissions: []    (MV2 — irrelevant)
```

A Chrome/Edge MV3 extension without `host_permissions` cannot inject the inpage script into arbitrary pages, which is the entire point of the wallet provider. This would produce a silently broken extension on Chrome/Edge.

**Recommended remediation:** Run `pnpm nx run cubensis-connect:build` and commit updated `dist/`. Add a CI gate that fails if `dist/` manifests do not match expected values from `adaptManifestToPlatform.js`.

---

### C-5 · MEDIUM — Password Minimum Length Enforced Only in UI

**Files:** `apps/cubensis-connect/src/ui/components/pages/NewAccount.tsx` (line 56), `apps/cubensis-connect/src/controllers/wallet.ts` (line 166)
**CWE:** CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements)
**References:** NIST SP 800-63B §5.1.1

**Description:**

`PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 8` is checked only in the React UI layer (`NewAccount.tsx`, `ChangePassword.tsx`). The `wallet.ts` background controller only checks `password?.length === 0` (empty guard). A call to the background RPC that bypasses the UI — for example, from an injected script or a malformed message — could set a 1-character password, dramatically weakening the vault encryption.

Per NIST SP 800-63B, the minimum length check must be enforced at the **service boundary** (background controller), not only in the presentation layer.

**Recommended remediation:**

```typescript
// wallet.ts — #setPassword
#setPassword(password: string | null) {
  if (password !== null && password.length < CONFIG.PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH) {
    throw new Error(`Password must be at least ${CONFIG.PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH} characters`);
  }
  // ...
}
```

---

### C-6 · MEDIUM — Analytics Events Include dApp Origin URLs

**File:** `apps/cubensis-connect/src/controllers/statistics.ts`
**CWE:** CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information)
**References:** GDPR Art. 5 (data minimisation); Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies §4 (user data)

**Description:**

The `allowOrigin`, `disableOrigin`, `approve`, and `reject` analytics event types include the `origin` property (the dApp URL) in the payload sent to Amplitude:

```typescript
| { eventType: 'allowOrigin'; origin: string }
| { eventType: 'approve'; origin: string | undefined; ... }
```

dApp origins in `event_properties` are transmitted to Amplitude's servers (`api2.amplitude.com`) and Mixpanel (`api-js.mixpanel.com`). These origins may reveal which dApps a user has approved — information that can be combined with timing data to infer trading or DeFi activity. Both Amplitude and Mixpanel are US-hosted third-party analytics services.

Chrome Web Store policy requires disclosure of any data transmitted to third parties. GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) requires data to be adequate, relevant, and **limited to what is necessary**.

**Recommended remediation:** Hash origins before inclusion in analytics events (e.g., SHA-256 truncated to 8 bytes), or omit `origin` from analytics payloads entirely. Document data transmission in the privacy policy.

---

### C-7 · MEDIUM — `getKEK` Returns Derived Shared Key to Any Approved dApp

**File:** `apps/cubensis-connect/src/background.ts` (lines 793–812)
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to Unauthorized Actor)

**Description:**

`getKEK` derives a shared X25519 key from the user's wallet private key and a caller-supplied public key, then returns it as a Base58-encoded string to *any dApp that has the `APPROVED` permission*:

```typescript
const sharedKey = await wallet.createSharedKey(publicKey, prefix);
return base58Encode(sharedKey);
```

The `createSharedKey` function uses X25519 (Curve25519 ECDH). The returned value is a **raw shared secret** — a 32-byte value derived from the user's private key. Possession of this KEK, combined with an intercepted encrypted message, directly enables decryption of messages intended for the user.

A malicious dApp that has been approved by the user can call `getKEK` with any public key and extract the derived secret, enabling offline decryption of past and future messages.

**Recommended remediation:** Add a user-approval prompt for `getKEK` calls (same as signing) so the user explicitly consents to key derivation for each dApp session. Document this in the API surface. Do not return raw shared secrets silently under the blanket `APPROVED` permission.

---

## Phase D — Configuration & Infrastructure

### D-1 · `X-XSS-Protection` Header Is Deprecated (INFO)

**Files:** `apps/exchange/nginx.conf`, `apps/exchange/docker/nginx/default.conf`

`X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` is deprecated in all modern browsers and **removed from MDN recommendations**. In some older browsers, this header can actually introduce XSS vulnerabilities by triggering the browser's built-in XSS filter incorrectly. The correct replacement is a well-configured `Content-Security-Policy`.

`apps/exchange/nginx.conf` now has a CSP (DCC-141); the deprecated header should be removed from both nginx configs.

### D-2 · Biome All Clean (INFO)

All 472 files in `cubensis-connect/src/` pass Biome with zero errors. No `biome-ignore` suppressions without justification.

### D-3 · No `@keeper-wallet/*` References (INFO)

Post DCC-118/119/120 — completely clean. Confirmed by grep across all source directories.

---

## Phase E — Missing Controls (Gaps)

| Gap | Risk | Recommendation |
|-----|------|----------------|
| No automated secret scanning in CI (gitleaks / truffleHog) | Secrets could be committed accidentally | Add `gitleaks detect` as a pre-commit hook and CI step |
| SBOM not generated | Can't verify supply chain integrity for store submission | Add `pnpm sbom` or `syft` to build pipeline |
| `dist/` committed to repo with no freshness check | Stale artifacts go unnoticed | Add CI step: `pnpm nx run cubensis-connect:build && git diff --exit-code apps/cubensis-connect/dist/` |
| No automated dependency pinning freshness | Abandoned packages accumulate | Renovate `abandonments:recommended` already configured; confirm `security:minimumReleaseAgeNpm` is active |
| No rate limiting on vault unlock attempts | Brute-force attack on vault | Implement exponential backoff + lockout after N failed unlock attempts in `VaultController.ts` |

---
