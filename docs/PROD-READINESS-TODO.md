# Production Readiness TODO

> **Audit Rounds 13 – 20 — Mar 27–28, 2026**
>
> ### What has been done (Rounds 13–15)
>
> **Round 13 — Bundle & Toolchain**
> - Lazy route split: `dexRoutes`, `settingsRoutes`, `walletRoutes` → React Router v7 `lazy()` — main bundle 6.2 MB → 3.5 MB (−43%)
> - `victory` charting library replaced with `recharts`
> - `tsdown` bumped `0.21.5 → 0.21.6`; `vite` bumped `^8.0.2 → ^8.0.3`
> - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` TypeScript version corrected to `6.0.x`
> - `release.yml` CI: `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` step added
>
> **Round 14 — TypeScript 7.0 Prep & TS 6 Correctness**
> - 5 TypeScript enums → `const` objects; `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` enabled
> - Biome 2.4 nursery rules enabled: `noDuplicateSelectors`, `noUntrustedLicenses`, `noInlineStyles`
> - `--stableTypeOrdering`: confirmed absent in TS 6.0.2 — tracked for TS 7.0
>
> **Round 15 — Code Quality & Documentation (P2/P3 completion)**
> - `recharts` removed; `@visx/shape` + `@visx/group` installed; `LeasingChart.tsx` rewritten as pure SVG
> - `react19-compat.d.ts` deleted — all deps (MUI 7.3.9, qrcode.react, react-icons) now React 19 JSX native
> - `networkConfig.ts`: `as unknown as MainnetConfig` → `satisfies MainnetConfig` (+ 3 narrow-type widenings)
> - 18 exchange `noInlineStyles` files converted to `styled-components`; `ErrorPage.tsx` and cubensis-connect HTML loading screens added to `biome.json` overrides (architecturally required)
> - `ride-js RSA verify` skip: root cause (Scala.js WASM has no RSA provider) + unblock path (`@noble/rsa`) documented in test file
> - `packages/transactions/README.md`: "chainId is required" callout added (`76='L'` silent default, DCC mainnet/testnet byte table)
> - **Workspace Biome**: 0 errors, **0 warnings** (down from 53 in Round 14)
>
> ### What has been done (Round 16 — Deep Enterprise Audit — Mar 27, 2026)
>
> **Security CVE resolved (CRITICAL)**
> - **`path-to-regexp` GHSA-37ch-88jc-xwx2 HIGH** — `@react-router/serve > express@4.22.1` pulls
>   `path-to-regexp@0.1.12` which is vulnerable to ReDoS via multiple route parameters.
>   Added `"path-to-regexp": ">=0.1.13"` to root `pnpm.overrides`. `pnpm audit` now returns
>   **0 vulnerabilities**. Lockfile regenerated.
>
> **Dependency freshness (all safe patch/minor bumps)**
> - `nx` + `@nx/devkit`: `22.6.2 → 22.6.3`
> - `i18next`: `^25.10.9 → ^25.10.10` — exchange + cubensis-connect
> - `electron`: `^41.0.4 → ^41.1.0` — Chromium security patches
> - `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb`: `^6.32.0 → ^6.33.0` — cubensis-connect
>
> **Dead config removed**
> - `cubensis-connect/biome.json`: Removed stale `noExplicitAny: off` override for
>   `src/controllers/VaultController.ts` — file has **zero** actual `any` annotations in
>   production code (the comment explaining not to use `any` was the only hit). Rule is
>   now active for VaultController, matching the rest of the codebase.
> - `knip.json`: Removed stale `"apps/exchange/src/types/react19-compat.d.ts"` from
>   `ignore` array — file was deleted in Round 15 and the entry was causing a
>   `knip configuration hint`.
>
> **Code deduplication — QRCode casts**
> - `as unknown as React.ComponentType<Record<string, unknown>>` appeared 5 times across
>   the exchange app — every file that used `qrcode.react` independently re-cast the
>   component. Centralized the cast in `components/display/QRCode.tsx` (exported) and
>   updated 3 consumers (`DepositAddress.tsx`, `ReceiveAssetModalModern.tsx`,
>   `QRReceive.tsx`) to import `QRCodeSVG`/`QRCodeCanvas` from there. Reduces
>   cast surface: future qrcode.react upgrades need one file changed, not five.
>
> **JSDoc example hygiene**
> - `TransactionConfirmationFlow.tsx`: replaced `console.log(...)` in JSDoc code example
>   with `logger.info(...)` — Biome `noConsole` was not flagging it (inside `/** */`
>   comment), but it set a bad example for copy-paste usage.
>
> **Gate results post-Round 16**
> - `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅
> - `biome check` → **0 errors, 0 warnings** across 1,756 files ✅
> - `typecheck` → **25/25** ✅
> - `test` → **1,227 passed / 1 skipped** (67/67 files) ✅
> - `check:boundaries` → **25/25** ✅
>
> ### What is still open

> | **INFRA** | Deploy DCC node infrastructure (DNS NXDOMAIN for all prod domains) | Ops team |
> | **P0** | Promote 5 npm packages `@next → @latest` | Node deployment |
> | **P0** | Wire exchange routing backlog (147 unreachable source files) | Node deployment |
> | **P0** | Gate 6 — Chrome/Firefox store submissions | Node deployment |
> | ~~**P1**~~ | ~~`react-ga4` 2.1.0 → 3.0.1 (v3 is ESM-only; API unchanged; released Mar 24 2026 — deferred)~~ **DONE (Audit 2, 2026-08-22)** — upgraded to v3 in commit `68d559ce7`; `pnpm outdated` → 0 ✅ | ✅ |
> | ~~**P2**~~ | ~~`cubensis-connect/biome.json`: `noNonNullAssertion: "off"` global~~ **DONE (Round 20)** — all 26 files fixed; 25-file override block removed; global `"error"` enforced with 0 per-file exemptions (1 inline `biome-ignore` for modulo-bounded index in `ducklings.ts`) | ✅ |
> | ~~**P2**~~ | ~~`cubensis-connect/biome.json`: `noExplicitAny: "off"` global for all `src/`~~ **DONE (Round 20)** — global removed; 13 usages handled (3 properly typed, 10 biome-ignore with technical justification) | ✅ |
> | **P2** | `matcherService.ts`: `useUserOrders()` + `useTradeHistory()` return `[]` with `enabled: false` (stubs pending matcher auth + data-service) | Node deployment |
> | **P2** | Wire Sentry DSN in `apps/exchange/.env.production` (no code change — just a DSN value) | sentry.io project |
> | **P2** | Profile `AuthContext-*.js` (467 kB) — confirm whether Sentry is the cause | — |
> | **P2** | Electron target decision — ship desktop build or remove `electron/` dir and deps | Product decision |
> | **P3** | `@react-router/dev` emits deprecation warning: `"esbuild" option deprecated, use "oxc"` — upstream react-router@7.13.2 issue, not in our vite.config.ts | Upstream |
> | **P3** | Nx AI agents: run `nx configure-ai-agents` in IDE (interactive — requires editor selection; cannot be scripted) | Engineering |
> | **P3** | TypeScript 7.0 prep — monitor TS 7 beta (Go port, H2 2026); `--stableTypeOrdering` | Upstream TS |
> | **P3** | ~~2 `it.todo` in `packages/transactions/test/`~~ **FULLY DONE** — invoke default function: `tx.call === null` promoted to passing test (Round 18); exchange v2+order v3 (ver2-1-3/ver2-2-3): promoted in prior session. Transfer byte attachment: promoted with 2 offline tests (Round 19). **346 passing, 0 todos.** | Engineering |
> | **P3** | ~~Transfer byte attachment binary fixture~~ **FULLY DONE (Round 19)** — `proto-serialize.spec.ts` `it.todo` replaced with passing test; 2 offline tests added to `transfer.spec.ts` (`describe('proto round-trip')`) so coverage runs in CI. **4,445 passing, 0 todos.** | Engineering |
> | **P3** | `ride-js` RSA verify `test.skip` — Scala.js WASM has no RSA provider; unblock via `@noble/rsa` shim | Upstream |
>
> **Gate summary**: All code quality gates clear. Release is BLOCKED on Gate 5 (node infrastructure deployment).
>
> ### What has been done (Round 17 — Deep Production Audit — Mar 27, 2026)
>
> **Tool changelog research** — all tools verified at absolute latest against official changelogs:
> - Biome **2.4.9** ✅ (latest; new nursery rules: `noDuplicateSelectors`, `noInlineStyles`, `noUntrustedLicenses`, `useNullishCoalescing`, `useImportsFirst` — all reviewed; no applicable new fixes needed)
> - Vite **8.0.3** ✅ (already pinned via `^8.0.3` in workspace)
> - TypeScript **6.0.2** ✅ (latest stable)
> - Vitest **4.1.2** ✅ (catalog pinned; flatted CVE already resolved in 4.1.2)
> - Nx **22.6.3** ✅; tsdown **0.21.6** ✅; pnpm **10.33.0** ✅
>
> **Security audit**: `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅
>
> **Type safety deep scan** — full codebase audit:
> - `@ts-ignore` in production code: **0** ✅
> - `@ts-nocheck` in production code: **0** ✅
> - `@ts-expect-error` in production code: **0** (all in test files with explicit justifications) ✅
> - `biome-ignore` suppressions: **all have justifications** ✅ — no orphaned suppressions found
> - `as unknown as` in production: **36 occurrences** — cataloged below
>
> **`as unknown as` audit** — all 36 occurrences reviewed:
> - **Exchange app** (21): QRCode centralization (already done Round 16), FormSelect/Sidebar MUI prop coercions, window flag extension, Ledger/media device adapter bridging, data-service parseTx type bridging, zodResolver version boundary, NavLink MUI coercion — all justified
> - **Scanner app** (4): Transaction union narrowing (confirmed/unconfirmed), error logger window extension, block header cast — all justified
> - **SDK packages** (11): BigNumber proto patching, parse-json-bignumber JSON walk, signature-adapter transaction narrowing, signer broadcast overload bridge, transactions proto-serialize, money-like-to-node converter — all justified with comments
> - **Verdict**: No unjustified `as unknown as` casts found. All are documented boundary-crossing coercions.
>
> **Dead code (knip)** — no unused exports, files, or dependencies. Config cleanup applied:
> - Removed 12 stale config hints: `vitest.base.config.ts`, `**/vitest.config.ts`, `**/vitest.unit.config.ts`, `**/vite.config.ts`, `**/tsdown.config.ts`, `**/.agents/**`, `**/.github/skills/**`, `**/.opencode/**`, `scripts/**`, `tools/**` from `ignore` (now auto-handled by knip 6)
> - Removed `wasm-pack` and `@testing-library/jest-dom` from `ignoreDependencies` (knip 6 now detects them natively)
> - Fixed stale entry: `src/notification.tsx` in apps/cubensis-connect (file deleted) → removed
> - Fixed stale entry: `src/main.tsx` in apps/scanner → replaced with `src/entry.client.tsx`, `src/root.tsx` (React Router 7 SSR structure)
> - Removed empty `"ignore": []` from packages/node-api-js workspace config
> - Knip hints reduced: **41 → 29** (remaining 29 are "Remove redundant entry pattern" for explicit per-package `src/index.ts` entries — kept for documentation clarity)
>
> **react-i18next 16.6.6 → 17.0.0** — **APPLIED** ✅
> - Breaking change analysis: v17 `transKeepBasicHtmlNodesFor` fix only affects **auto-generated** Trans keys (no explicit `i18nKey`). **All 314 Trans/useTranslation usages in this codebase use explicit `i18nKey`** — zero breaking impact confirmed.
> - Upgraded in both `apps/exchange/package.json` and `apps/cubensis-connect/package.json`
> - Typecheck 25/25 ✅, biome-lint 25/25 ✅, test 25/25 ✅ after upgrade
>
> **react-ga4 2.1.0 → 3.0.1** — **DEFERRED** (was P1) → moved to P1 with new notes:
> - v3.0.1 published only 3 days ago (2026-03-24); only 2,416 downloads vs 462,155 for v2 — too early to adopt for production
> - v3 is now ESM-only (no CJS `main` field); API appears unchanged (`initialize`, `send`, `event`, `set`)
> - Defer until >30k downloads or explicit changelog verification from PriceRunner
>
> **Gate results post-Round 17**
> - `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅
> - `biome check` → **0 errors, 0 warnings** ✅
> - `typecheck` → **25/25** ✅
> - `test` → **25/25** ✅
> - `check:boundaries` → **25/25** ✅
> - `pnpm outdated` → **0 packages** (react-ga4 is pinned to `2.1.0`; v3 is a semver-major — not surfaced by outdated within the `^2` range) ✅

> ### What has been done (Round 18 — Super Deep 100×100 Enterprise Production Audit — Mar 27, 2026)
>
> **Tool changelog research** — all tools re-verified at absolute latest (same-day releases checked):
> - Biome **2.4.9** ✅ — released 3 days ago; confirmed still latest (no 2.4.10+)
> - Vite **8.0.3** ✅ — released 2 days ago; confirmed still latest
> - Vitest **4.1.2** ✅ — released yesterday; v4.1.2 bumps `flatted` to resolve a CVE in flatted < 3.3.3
> - Nx **22.6.3** ✅ — released **today** (2026-03-27); we are at the bleeding-edge of the latest stable
> - tsdown **0.21.6** ✅ — released **20 hours ago**; v0.21.5 added explicit TypeScript v6 support; v0.21.6 adds rolldown rc.12 + `cjsReexport` option (not applicable to our ESM-only setup)
> - TypeScript **6.0.2** ✅; pnpm **10.33.0** ✅; Node.js **v24.14.0** ✅ (tsdown 0.21.0+ deprecates Node <22.18.0 — we're at 24.14.0)
>
> **invoke default-function `it.todo` FIXED**
> - Root cause was a stale comment: "needs fixture update" — `callField()` in `invoke-script.ts`
>   already returns `null` for missing/null `call`; no live node or fixture update required.
> - Replaced `it.todo('Should create invoke tx for default function — needs fixture update')` with
>   a passing test asserting `tx.call === null`, `tx.dApp`, and `tx.type === 16`.
> - **`packages/transactions`: 344 tests passing, 0 todos** (up from 343/1 in Round 17)
>
> **Suppression deep audit** — full re-scan of packages + apps:
> - Total suppressions (biome-ignore + @ts-expect-error + as unknown as + eslint-disable): **221**
> - `as unknown as` in `packages/*/src`: **17 occurrences** — all documented with justification
>   (boundary-crossing coercions: BigNumber prototype patch, signature-adapter tx narrowing, signer
>   broadcast overload bridge, money-like-to-node converter, parse-json-bignumber JSON walk,
>   cubensis-connect-provider SignedTx return, node-api-js typed list return, transactions proto-serialize)
> - `as unknown as` in `apps/*/src`: **30 occurrences** — all in React component prop coercions
>   (QRCode wrappers centralized in Round 16, NavLink/MUI, window extensions)
> - `@ts-expect-error`: **0 in production code** — only in test files for intentional wrong-type testing ✅
> - `biome-ignore`: all have explanatory comments; 0 naked suppressions ✅
> - **Verdict**: suppression profile is healthy. No new orphaned or unjustified suppressions.
>
> **Dead code (knip)** — confirmed 0 dead code; 29 "Remove redundant entry" hints (intentional — kept for docs clarity; same as post-Round 17 cleanup)
>
> **Bundle sizes (JS-only .mjs)** — all packages built with `nx run-many build`:
> | Package | index.mjs |
> |---------|-----------|
> | transactions | 88 K |
> | signature-adapter | 75 K |
> | ts-lib-crypto (crypto chunk) | 53 K |
> | marshall | 46 K |
> | protobuf-serialization | 45 K |
> | signer | 37 K |
> | node-api-js | 25 K |
> | ledger | 23 K |
> | browser-bus | 19 K |
> | ≤ 18 K each | remaining 12 packages |
>
> Shared rolldown chunk `chunk-CfYAbeIz.mjs` used by both transactions and marshall — tree-shaking and deduplication working correctly.
>
> **Node.js version compliance** — Node.js `>=24` required in root `package.json`; running v24.14.0 locally. tsdown 0.21.0+ deprecation warning threshold (Node < 22.18.0) is well satisfied.
>
> **Gate results post-Round 18**
> - `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅
> - `biome-lint` → **25/25 projects, 0 errors, 0 warnings** ✅
> - `typecheck` → **25/25** ✅
> - `test` → **25/25 projects** ✅ — **4,443 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed / 0 todos** (25 projects)
> - `pnpm outdated` → **0** (react-ga4 pinned below major; deferred) ✅
> - knip → **0 dead code** ✅

> ### What has been done (Round 19 — Console Leaks, Null Assertions, Proto-Serialize — Mar 28, 2026)
>
> **Console leaks eliminated**
> - `apps/cubensis-connect/src/controllers/message.ts`: Removed redundant `console.error(err)` from
>   `newMessage()` catch block — Sentry's `captureException(err)` on the next line already handles
>   observability; the console call was a production leak of raw stack traces.
> - `apps/cubensis-connect/src/background.ts`: Replaced `console.warn('validatePermission: stale
>   messageId lookup failed', err)` with `captureException(err)` — routes the diagnostic to Sentry
>   with full context instead of printing to the service worker console.
> - `apps/cubensis-connect/src/inpage.ts` (2× `console.warn`): **Kept intentionally** — these are
>   developer-facing API deprecation notices (`initialPromise`, `WavesKeeper`/`Waves`/`KeeperWallet`
>   globals) that run in the web-page context; dApp authors need to see them in their browser devtools
>   to know they must migrate to `CubensisConnect`.
>
> **Null assertion audit — `message.ts` (15 assertions → 0)**
> - Added `pickDefaultTxVersion<T extends number>(versions: T[], txType: …): T` module-level helper
>   that calls `invariant(versions.length > 0, …)` then returns `versions[0] as T`. Centralized the
>   non-null access into one audited function with an explicit invariant error message; `as T` cast is
>   safe because the invariant guarantees the array is non-empty.
> - Replaced all **14 × `versions[0]!`** occurrences (across 14 transaction-type `case` blocks in
>   `#generateMessageTx`) with `pickDefaultTxVersion(versions, messageInputTx.type)`.
> - Fixed **1 × `base58Decode(address)[1]!`** (order params `chainId` fallback): extracted
>   `accountAddrBytes` before the object literal with `invariant(accountAddrBytes.length >= 2, …)` +
>   `const chainIdFromAddress = accountAddrBytes[1] as number` — DCC addresses are always ≥ 2 bytes
>   by protocol; invariant makes the assumption explicit and fail-fast.
>
> **`noNonNullAssertion` promoted from global `"off"` to per-file overrides**
> - `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json`: Global `noNonNullAssertion: "off"` → `"error"`.
> - Added new per-file override block listing the **25 remaining src files** (+ test override) that
>   still have `!` assertions — each file now carries an explicit `"off"` override (a tracked debt
>   list, not a blanket exemption). `message.ts` is no longer in the override list and is therefore
>   protected from regression by the global `"error"` rule.
>
> **proto-serialize `it.todo` FIXED (transfer byte attachment)**
> - `proto-serialize.spec.ts` `it.todo('correctly serializes transfers with byte attachments')`: 
>   Replaced with a passing test using the pre-existing `transferWithByteAttachment` fixture
>   (renamed from `_a`). Test verifies base58Decode → protobuf encode → protoBytesToTx → base58Encode
>   round-trip for a v3 transfer with a non-empty binary attachment.
> - **Additionally**: added 2 inline tests to `test/transactions/transfer.spec.ts`
>   (`describe('proto round-trip: transfer with byte attachment')`) so byte-attachment coverage runs
>   in the **normal (offline) CI test suite** — not just the excluded integration file.
>   Tests use `Uint8Array([0x00, 0x01, 0xab, 0xff, 0x42])` to exercise non-printable bytes, plus
>   an empty-attachment control case.
>
> **Gate results post-Round 19**
> - `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅ (unchanged)
> - `biome-lint` → **25/25 projects, 0 errors, 0 warnings** ✅
> - `typecheck` → **25/25** ✅
> - `test` → **25/25 projects** ✅ — **4,445 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed / 0 todos**
>   (transactions: 346 ↑ from 344; +2 byte-attachment tests)
> - `pnpm outdated` → **0** ✅
> - knip → **0 dead code** ✅

> ### What has been done (Round 20 — Null Assertions, noExplicitAny, Bundle Audit — Mar 28, 2026)
>
> #### Item 12 — cubensis-connect `noNonNullAssertion`: all 26 files fully cleaned
>
> The Round 19 per-file `noNonNullAssertion: "off"` override block listed 25 files. All 25 were
> fixed, and one additional file (`ConfirmBackup.tsx`) was also cleaned, bringing the total to
> **26 files**. Every fix follows one of three patterns:
> - **`invariant(x != null, msg)` guard** — extract index access to a local variable, assert it's
>   non-null with a descriptive message; `tiny-invariant` is already a project dependency
> - **`?? fallback`** — where `null`/`undefined` is semantically safe (`?? []`, `?? 0`, `?? ''`)
> - **`?.` optional chaining** — for notification fields that are genuinely optional at call time
>
> File-by-file changes:
>
> | File | Assertion(s) | Fix |  
> |------|-------------|-----|
> | `tabNfts.tsx` | `creatorCounts[creator]! + 1` | `(creatorCounts[creator] ?? 0) + 1` |
> | `preferences.ts` | `sortedAccounts[0]!.address` | `sortedAccounts[0]?.address` |
> | `highlight.tsx` | `Prism.languages[language]!` | `const grammar = …; invariant(grammar != null, …)` |
> | `network.ts` | `base58Decode(address)[1]!` | `const addrBytes = …; invariant(addrBytes.length >= 2, …); addrBytes[1] as number` |
> | `nftList.tsx` | `rows[leftIndex]!` | `const leftNft = …; invariant(leftNft != null, …)` |
> | `ducklings.ts` | 2× modulo-bounded array | First: `invariant(arr.length > 0) + as string`; second: inline `biome-ignore` (modulo guarantees bounds) |
> | `NewWallet.tsx` | `generatedWalletItems[0]!` | `find(…) ?? generatedWalletItems[0]; invariant(selected != null, …)` |
> | `bottomPanel.tsx` | `networkHash[network]!` | `const newNet = …; invariant(newNet != null, …)` |
> | `storage.ts` | `MIGRATIONS[i]!.migrate()`, `MIGRATIONS[i-1]!.rollback()` | Extract to `const migration`/`rollback`; `invariant(migration/rollback != null, …)` each |
> | `notifications.ts` | `item!.origin`, `notify[0]!.origin`, `payload.notifications[0]!` | `?.` optional chaining throughout |
> | `utils.ts` (messages) | `parts[2]!` | `parts[2] ?? ''` (inside `parts.length === 3` branch — semantically equivalent) |
> | `tabTxHistory.tsx` | `historyWithGroups[index]!`, `prevItems[index-1]!`, rowHeight callback | `const historyOrGroup = …; invariant(…)`; `as TransactionFromNode`; `const row = …; row != null && 'groupName' in row ? …` |
> | `updateState.ts` | `acc.hash[item.origin]! ×2` | Refactored reduce: `let group = acc.hash[item.origin]; if (!group) { group = []; acc.hash[item.origin] = group; … } group.push(item)` |
> | `List.tsx` | `origins[name]! ×2` | `origins[name] ?? []` |
> | `tabAssets.tsx` | `assetEntries[index]!` | `const entry = …; invariant(entry != null, …); const [assetId, …] = entry` |
> | `importLedger.tsx` | `ledgerUsersPages[page]!` | `ledgerUsersPages[page] ?? []` |
> | `messagesAndNotifications.tsx` | `group[0]!.origin`, `group[0]!.title` ×3 | `const firstItem = group[0]; invariant(firstItem != null, …)` then use `firstItem` |
> | `form.tsx` | `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE_OPTIONS[idx]!`, `finalFeeOptions[0]!` | `invariant(slippageTolerance != null, …)`; conditional render `{finalFeeOptions[0] != null && formatFeeOption(…)}` |
> | `swap.tsx` | `match[1]!`, `match[2]!`, `match[1]!` | `match[1] ?? '0'`, `match[2] ?? '0'` |
> | `Modal.tsx` | `styles.modalWrapper!`, `elRef.current!` | `invariant(styles.modalWrapper != null, …)`; capture `const el = elRef.current; invariant(el != null, …)` in `useEffect` |
> | `tooltip/index.tsx` | `modal.modalWrapper!` | `invariant(modal.modalWrapper != null, …)` |
> | `wallet.ts` | `networks[wallet.data.networkCode]!` | `const networkName = …; invariant(networkName != null, …)` |
> | `background.ts` | `msg.input.data[index]!` | `const inputDatum = msg.input.data[index]; invariant(inputDatum != null, …)` hoisted before `trackMessageEvent` |
> | `transactionPackage.tsx` | `input.data[index]!` | `const inputDatum = …; invariant(inputDatum != null, …)` |
> | `ConfirmBackup.tsx` | `list[i]! / list[j]!` in CSPRNG Fisher-Yates shuffle | `const itemI = list[i]; const itemJ = list[j]; invariant(itemI != null && itemJ != null, …)` |
> | `ducklings.ts` | `rand[0]!` (Uint32Array index) | `rand[0] as number` — `Uint32Array(1)` always has index 0; `as number` is safe without `!` |
>
> The entire 25-file `noNonNullAssertion: "off"` override block has been **deleted** from
> `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json`. `noNonNullAssertion: "error"` now applies globally with
> zero per-file exemptions; `ducklings.ts` has one inline `biome-ignore` (modulo-bounded).
>
> #### Item 13 — cubensis-connect `noExplicitAny`: global `"off"` removed
>
> Removed the global `"noExplicitAny": "off"` from the main `suspicious` rules section
> of `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json` (test file override retained separately).
> 13 `any` usages across 8 production files handled:
>
> | File | Usage | Resolution |
> |------|-------|------------|
> | `storage.ts` | `catch (err: any)` | `catch (err: unknown)` + `err instanceof Error` narrowing to get `err.message` |
> | `ipc.ts` | `(...args: any[])` in `ApiObject` type | Reverted to `any[]` with `biome-ignore` — `strictFunctionTypes` contravariance makes `unknown[]` incompatible with concrete API method signatures |
> | `tooltip/index.tsx` | `MutableRefObject<any>` | Changed to `MutableRefObject<HTMLElement \| null>` then **reverted** to `MutableRefObject<any>` with `biome-ignore` — `RefObject<T>` is invariant so `HTMLElement\|null` is not assignable to `Ref<HTMLButtonElement>` |
> | `remoteConfig.ts` ×2 | Complex config merge | `biome-ignore` — `extendValues` merges heterogeneous config objects where `any` is the structural supertype |
> | `tabTxHistory.tsx` | `.filter((tx: any)` | `biome-ignore` — `TransactionFromNode` is a wide discriminated union; filter accesses optional properties via `??` |
> | `Copy.tsx` ×4 | `React.ReactElement<any>` | `biome-ignore` — `ReactElement<any>` is required for `cloneElement` wrapper that accesses `.props` dynamically |
> | `Tabs.tsx` ×2 | `React.ReactElement<any>` | Same `biome-ignore` pattern |
> | `DropdownButton.tsx` ×1 | `React.ReactElement<any>` | Same `biome-ignore` pattern |
>
> **`biome-lint` passes: 475 files, 0 issues** ✅ · **`typecheck` passes: 0 errors** ✅
>
> The two changes that initially caused typecheck failures and required reversion:
> - `ipc.ts` `readonly unknown[]` → TypeScript `strictFunctionTypes` contravariance meant `UiApi`
>   and `PageApi` objects (whose methods have specific typed params) were not assignable to
>   `Record<K, (...args: unknown[]) => Promise<unknown>>` — **13 errors** across `accounts.tsx`,
>   `background.ts`, `popup.tsx`, `inpage.ts`. Reverted to `any[]` with `biome-ignore`.
> - `tooltip/index.tsx` `MutableRefObject<HTMLElement | null>` → `RefObject<T>` is invariant, so
>   `MutableRefObject<HTMLElement | null>` is not assignable to `Ref<HTMLButtonElement>` or
>   `Ref<HTMLDivElement>` — **9 errors** across `bottomPanel.tsx`, `activeAccountCard.tsx`,
>   `accountCard.tsx`, `AddressBook.tsx`, `assetItem.tsx`, `wallet.tsx`. Reverted with `biome-ignore`.
>
> #### Item 14 — exchange `noNonNullAssertion` promoted to `"error"`

>
> #### Item 15 — exchange `noExplicitAny` promoted to `"error"`
>
> Added `"noExplicitAny": "error"` to `apps/exchange/biome.json` `suspicious` rules.
> Exchange production code has exactly one `any` usage: `lib/forms.ts` line 37 — `zodResolver(schema as any)`
> to bridge a version boundary between `zod` and `react-hook-form`'s `zodResolver` overloads.
> Already suppressed with a justified `biome-ignore` from a prior round.
> **`biome-lint` passes: 408 files, 0 issues** ✅ · **`typecheck` passes** ✅
>
> #### Item 23 — `AuthContext-*.js` (467 kB) bundle profiled: root cause confirmed, Sentry placement fixed
>
> Profiled the existing `dist/` build artefact `AuthContext-lH5spWUm.js` (478 KB unminified):
>
> - **Sentry is NOT the cause** — `__SENTRY__`, `SentryError`, `getCurrentHub`, `withScope`:
>   none present in the chunk. Sentry was found only in `Leasing-Dt443Il4.js` (lazy route).
> - **Actual contributors** confirmed via content analysis:
>   - **Ramda** (transducer/fantasy-land pipeline) — pulled via `data-service` matcher/order API. Present exclusively in this chunk.
>   - **@noble crypto** (`sha256`, `Field.ORDER`) — pulled via `multiAccount` seed signing. Present exclusively in this chunk.
>   - **react-ga4** (~3 kB) + **multiAccount** seed encryption layer (small contribution)
>   - No cross-chunk duplication: none of these appear in any other chunk, so there is no
>     deduplication opportunity. The 467 kB reflects the mandatory auth + crypto surface.
>   - **Verdict**: size is **structurally sound and acceptable** for an auth/crypto boundary chunk.
>
> **Bonus fix — Sentry chunk placement corrected:**
> Sentry was ending up in `Leasing-Dt443Il4.js` (the `/wallet/leasing` lazy route) because
> there was no `manualChunks` rule for `@sentry/*`. Vite co-located Sentry with the first
> lazy feature that imported a Sentry consumer. This meant error capture was deferred until
> the user navigated to the Leasing page — a production observability hole.
> Added to `apps/exchange/vite.config.ts`:
> ```ts
> if (/node_modules\/@sentry\//.test(id)) {
>   // Sentry must be in its own chunk, not co-located with lazy feature routes.
>   return 'sentry';
> }
> ```
> Sentry now always loads in a dedicated `sentry-*.js` chunk on startup.
>
> **Gate results post-Round 20**
> - `pnpm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** ✅ (unchanged)
> - `biome-lint` → **25/25 projects, 0 errors, 0 warnings** ✅
> - `typecheck` → **25/25** ✅
> - `test` → **25/25 projects** ✅ — **4,445 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed / 0 todos** (unchanged)

## Priority Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **INFRA** | External infrastructure — cannot be resolved in this codebase |
| **P0** | Release blocker (`@next` publish, store submission) |
| **P1** | Must fix before shipping to users (dependency freshness, CI gaps) |
| **P2** | Must fix before next major release cycle (tech debt, TS 7.0 prep) |
| **P3** | Future / optional improvements |

---

## INFRA — Infrastructure Blockers (Gate 5)

These block the release gate. No code changes will unblock them.

- [ ] **Deploy DecentralChain node infrastructure** — DNS returns `NXDOMAIN` for all production domains:
  - `nodes.decentralchain.io`
  - `nodes-testnet.decentralchain.io`
  - `api.decentralchain.io`
  - `mainnet-matcher.decentralchain.io`
  
  Until these are live, Gate 5 of `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` cannot be cleared, and the exchange
  routing backlog cannot be wired (node API calls would 404).

---

## P0 — Release Blockers (code work, unblocked by node deployment)

- [ ] **Promote 5 npm packages from `@next` → `@latest`** once node is live:
  ```bash
  npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/assets-pairs-order@5.0.1 latest
  npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/marshall@1.0.0 latest
  npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/node-api-js@2.0.0 latest
  npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/signer@2.0.0 latest
  npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/signature-adapter@7.0.0 latest
  ```

- [ ] **Wire exchange routing backlog** (147 source files) — Fully implemented features not yet
  reachable from routing entry points. Wire one feature group at a time as the node API becomes
  available. Remove the corresponding `ignore` pattern from `knip.json` once wired.
  Feature groups: transaction forms (Zod + RHF), data-service layer (`DataManager`, `UTXManager`),
  DEX WebSocket hooks, settings pages, session management, wallet modals, auth flow, 
  `src/lib/**`, `src/api/**`, `src/services/**`, `src/stores/**`, `src/styles/**`, `src/types/**`, 
  `src/utils/**`.

- [ ] **Gate 6 — Extension store submissions**:
  - Chrome Web Store listing (text, screenshots, privacy policy)
  - Firefox AMO listing + source code submission package
  - Requires Gate 5 clearance first

---

## P1 — Must Fix Before Shipping

### Dependency Freshness

- [x] ~~`pnpm-workspace.yaml`: bump `tsdown: 0.21.5 → 0.21.6`~~ **DONE (this audit)**
- [x] ~~`apps/exchange/package.json`: bump `vite: ^8.0.2 → ^8.0.3`~~ **DONE (this audit)**
- [x] ~~**Run `pnpm install` to update `pnpm-lock.yaml`**~~ **DONE** — lock file updated; recharts@3.8.1 installed.

### CI/CD Gaps

- [x] ~~**`release.yml`: add pre-publish audit step**~~ **DONE** — `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`
  step added to `.github/workflows/release.yml` between "Install dependencies" and "Biome format".

### Exchange Bundle (Ongoing)

The lazy route conversion (this audit) reduced the critical-path main bundle from **6.2 MB → 3.5 MB**
(-43%) by converting `dexRoutes`, `settingsRoutes`, and `walletRoutes` to React Router v7 `lazy()`.

The remaining large chunks are:

| Chunk | Size (minified) | gzip | Status |
|-------|-----------------|------|--------|
| `index-*.js` (main) | 3.5 MB | ~1.0 MB | ✅ Reduced (was 6.2 MB) |
| `Leasing-*.js` | 2.67 MB | ~779 kB | ⚠️ See note below — no net reduction |
| `AuthContext-*.js` | 467 kB | ~153 kB | See P2 |
| `mui-core-*.js` | 416 kB | ~127 kB | Vendor chunk, expected |

- [x] ~~**`victory` charting library replaced**~~ **DONE** — `victory@^37.3.6` removed; `recharts@^3.8.1`
  installed. `LeasingChart.tsx` fully rewritten (`PieChart/Pie/ResponsiveContainer`, no deprecated
  `Cell`). TypeScript typechecks clean.

  > ⚠️ **Bundle size correction (Round 14 re-audit):** The Leasing chunk measured **2.67 MB** post-recharts
  > vs **2.5 MB** pre-recharts — essentially unchanged, slightly larger. The Round 13 claim
  > "reduced ~1.8 MB" was wrong. Both victory and recharts bundle comparable d3 sub-packages.
  > To meaningfully reduce the chunk, a lightweight library is needed: `@visx/pie` (<20 kB for
  > PieChart alone) or a custom SVG/canvas approach. Tracked as P2 item below.

---

## P2 — Before Next Major Release Cycle

### TypeScript 7.0 Preparation

- [x] ~~**Migrate 4 TypeScript enums to `const` objects** in `apps/exchange`~~ **DONE** — all 5 enum
  declarations migrated to `export const X = {...} as const; export type X = ...` pattern:
  - `errorMonitoring.ts` — `ErrorSeverity`
  - `websocket.ts` — `WebSocketState`, `MessageType`
  - `gateways/types.ts` — `GatewayErrorCode`
  - `transactionService.ts` — `TransactionType` (plus `typeof` fix in `TransferTransaction` interface)
  
  `"erasableSyntaxOnly": true` is now enabled in `apps/exchange/tsconfig.base.json`.

- [x] ~~**`--stableTypeOrdering` flag**~~ **NOT YET IN TS 6.0.2** — `pnpm exec tsc --all | grep stable` returns nothing. This flag does not exist in the installed TypeScript 6.0.2 release. Tracked as a TS 7.0 item below in P3. Will add to `tsconfig.base.json` when the flag ships.

### Documentation Accuracy

- [x] ~~`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: toolchain table still said `TypeScript | 5.9.x`~~ **FIXED (this audit)**
  — Updated to `6.0.x` and rationale updated to reference TS 6.0 features.

### Type Safety

- [x] ~~**`apps/exchange/src/config/networkConfig.ts` `as unknown as MainnetConfig`**~~ **DONE** — Replaced with spread + `satisfies MainnetConfig`. Three JSON fields required explicit widening (assets, gateway, tradingPairs) which tsc now validates structurally. `networkConfig.ts` lines 19-29.

### Observability

- [ ] **Wire Sentry DSN for exchange** — `@sentry/react@^10.45.0` is already installed. `initErrorMonitoring({...})`
  is already called in `apps/exchange/src/App.tsx`. `apps/exchange/.env.production` already has
  `VITE_SENTRY_ENABLED=true` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN=` (empty). **Only missing: a real DSN value.**
  1. Create Sentry project for `exchange` at sentry.io
  2. Paste DSN into `apps/exchange/.env.production` → `VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/yyy`
  3. Rebuild and deploy — monitoring will activate automatically
  
  No code changes required.

### Bundle Size — LeasingChart & Shared Deps

- [x] ~~**`Leasing-*.js` replace recharts**~~ **DONE** — `recharts` removed. `@visx/shape` + `@visx/group` installed. `LeasingChart.tsx` rewritten as pure SVG using `<Pie>` from `@visx/shape`. Typecheck clean, biome 0 warnings.

- [x] ~~**Profile `AuthContext-*.js` (467 kB)**~~ **DONE (Round 20)** — Profiled against `dist/` build.
  **Sentry is NOT the cause.** Root causes: Ramda (data-service) + @noble crypto (multiAccount
  signature primitives) + multiAccount seed encryption layer. All legitimate for the auth boundary.
  Size is structurally sound. **Bonus fix**: added `@sentry/ → 'sentry'` to `vite.config.ts`
  `manualChunks` so Sentry always loads in its own dedicated chunk, not inside lazy feature routes.

### Biome Rule Gaps

- [x] ~~**Evaluate new nursery rules from Biome 2.4.5–2.4.9**~~ **DONE** — 3 rules added to root
  `biome.json` under `linter.rules.nursery`:
  - `noDuplicateSelectors: "warn"` — CSS duplicate selector detection
  - `noUntrustedLicenses: "warn"` — dependency license alerting
  - `noInlineStyles: "warn"` — JSX inline style enforcement
  
  **0 warnings remain** (down from 53 in Round 14). All 18 exchange component files converted
  to styled-components patterns in Round 15. `ErrorPage.tsx` and cubensis-connect HTML shell
  files (popup/accounts/notification) added to per-app `biome.json` overrides with justification
  (outside MUI context / pre-boot HTML loading screens, architecturally required).

### Electron Target Clarification

- [ ] **`apps/exchange/electron/` — production-ready scaffold, build not wired into Nx** — The
  directory is fully implemented (not a stub): `main.ts`, `preload.ts`, `entitlements.mac.plist`,
  `electron:build` / `electron:build:mac` / `electron:build:win` / `electron:build:linux` scripts
  in `package.json`, and `electron-builder` configured with appId `com.decentralchain.exchange`.
  Pre-built compiled `.js` artifacts are committed alongside the TypeScript sources.
  
  What's missing: an Nx project target (`exchange:electron:build`) and a CI workflow for the desktop
  distribution. Decision needed: ship electron desktop or remove? If ship — add
  `electron:build` as an Nx target and a `release-desktop.yml` workflow. If not — remove the
  `electron/` directory and `electron`/`electron-builder`/`electron-updater` deps to reduce attack
  surface and clean up `package.json`.

### Test Coverage Gap

- [x] ~~**`ride-js/test/compiler.spec.ts` RSA verify skip**~~ **DOCUMENTED** — Root cause (Scala.js WASM
  has no native RSA provider) + unblock path (`@noble/rsa` shim or upstream fix) documented in the
  test file. Safe to leave skipped until upstream resolution.

---

## P3 — Future / Optional

- [x] ~~**`packages/browser-bus` wildcard `targetOrigin`**~~ **ALREADY DONE** — `WindowProtocol`
  already throws `Error` when `type === DISPATCH && targetOrigin === '*'`. Callers must
  pass an explicit origin. The P3 item was stale. Verified in `src/protocols/WindowProtocol.ts`.

- [x] ~~**`noImportCycles` Biome rule evaluation**~~ **ALREADY DONE** — `suspicious.noImportCycles: "error"`
  has been active in root `biome.json` since Round 6. The exchange app has zero violations
  (cycles fixed in Round 6). No override needed. The P3 item was stale.

- [x] ~~**Monitor `apps/exchange/src/react19-compat.d.ts`**~~ **DELETED (Round 15)** — All deps
  (MUI 7.3.9, qrcode.react 4.2.0, react-icons 5.6.0) now declare React 19 JSX natively.
  Recharts removal eliminated the last consumer of the old `@types/recharts` JSX namespace.

- [x] ~~**`packages/transactions` chainId documentation**~~ **DONE** — Added "chainId is required"
  callout section to `packages/transactions/README.md` with network byte table (DCC mainnet `?`/63,
  testnet `!`/33), explicit vs implicit examples, and warning about the silent `76='L'` default.

- [ ] **TypeScript 7.0** — Monitor the TS 7.0 beta (Go port, expected H2 2026). Key changes
  that affect this codebase:
  - Enums are removed — requires P2 enum migration above
  - `--stableTypeOrdering` becomes the default
  - `moduleResolution: bundler` remains fully supported
  - `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` becomes the default setting
  
  Run `npx tsx typecheck` with `--stableTypeOrdering` before upgrading to catch ordering issues.

## Already Fixed — Round 20

### cubensis-connect null assertion cleanup (26 files)

| File | Assertion removed | Fix applied |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `tabNfts.tsx` | `creatorCounts[creator]!` | `(creatorCounts[creator] ?? 0) + 1` |
| `preferences.ts` | `sortedAccounts[0]!.address` | `sortedAccounts[0]?.address` |
| `highlight.tsx` | `Prism.languages[language]!` | `const grammar = Prism.languages[language]; invariant(grammar != null, …)` |
| `network.ts` | `base58Decode(address)[1]!` | `const addrBytes = base58Decode(address); invariant(addrBytes.length >= 2, …); addrBytes[1] as number` |
| `nftList.tsx` | `rows[leftIndex]!` | `const leftNft = rows[leftIndex]; invariant(leftNft != null, …)` |
| `ducklings.ts` (1st) | modulo-bounded array access | `invariant(arr.length > 0) + as string` |
| `ducklings.ts` (2nd) | modulo-bounded array access | inline `biome-ignore` — modulo guarantees in-bounds |
| `NewWallet.tsx` | `generatedWalletItems[0]!` | `find(…) ?? generatedWalletItems[0]; invariant(selected != null, …)` |
| `bottomPanel.tsx` | `networkHash[network]!` | `const newNet = networkHash[network]; invariant(newNet != null, …)` |
| `storage.ts` | `MIGRATIONS[i]!`, `MIGRATIONS[i-1]!` | Extract to local vars; `invariant(migration/rollback != null, …)` each |
| `notifications.ts` | `item!.origin`, `notify[0]!.origin`, `payload.notifications[0]!` | `?.` optional chaining throughout |
| `utils.ts` (messages) | `parts[2]!` | `parts[2] ?? ''` (inside `parts.length === 3` guard) |
| `tabTxHistory.tsx` | `historyWithGroups[index]!`, `prevItems[index-1]!`, rowHeight callback | `invariant(historyOrGroup != null, …)`; `as TransactionFromNode`; null-guarded ternary |
| `updateState.ts` | `acc.hash[item.origin]! ×2` | Refactored reduce: null-check + create group array if absent |
| `List.tsx` | `origins[name]! ×2` | `origins[name] ?? []` |
| `tabAssets.tsx` | `assetEntries[index]!` | `const entry = assetEntries[index]; invariant(entry != null, …)` |
| `importLedger.tsx` | `ledgerUsersPages[page]!` | `ledgerUsersPages[page] ?? []` |
| `messagesAndNotifications.tsx` | `group[0]!.origin/title ×3` | `const firstItem = group[0]; invariant(firstItem != null, …)` |
| `form.tsx` | `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE_OPTIONS[idx]!`, `finalFeeOptions[0]!` | `invariant(slippageTolerance != null, …)`; conditional `{finalFeeOptions[0] != null && …}` |
| `swap.tsx` | `match[1]!`, `match[2]!`, `match[1]!` | `match[1] ?? '0'`, `match[2] ?? '0'` |
| `Modal.tsx` | `styles.modalWrapper!`, `elRef.current!` | `invariant(styles.modalWrapper != null, …)`; `const el = elRef.current; invariant(el != null, …)` |
| `tooltip/index.tsx` | `modal.modalWrapper!` | `invariant(modal.modalWrapper != null, …)` |
| `wallet.ts` | `networks[wallet.data.networkCode]!` | `const networkName = networks[…]; invariant(networkName != null, …)` |
| `background.ts` | `msg.input.data[index]!` | `const inputDatum = msg.input.data[index]; invariant(inputDatum != null, …)` |

| `ConfirmBackup.tsx` | `list[i]!`, `list[j]!` in CSPRNG Fisher-Yates shuffle | `const itemI = list[i]; const itemJ = list[j]; invariant(itemI != null && itemJ != null, …)` |

**Config change**: entire 25-file `noNonNullAssertion: "off"` override block deleted from `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json`. Rule is now globally `"error"` with zero per-file exemptions (1 inline `biome-ignore` on the modulo-bounded `ducklings.ts` access).

### cubensis-connect noExplicitAny (8 files, 13 usages)

| File | Usage | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| `storage.ts` | `catch (err: any)` | `catch (err: unknown)` + `instanceof Error` narrowing |
| `ipc.ts` | `(...args: any[])` in `ApiObject` | Kept `any[]` + `biome-ignore` — `strictFunctionTypes` contravariance (concrete API methods not assignable to `unknown[]`) |
| `tooltip/index.tsx` | `MutableRefObject<any>` | Kept `any` + `biome-ignore` — `RefObject<T>` is invariant; `HTMLElement\|null` not assignable to `Ref<HTMLButtonElement>` |
| `remoteConfig.ts` ×2 | config merge | `biome-ignore` — `extendValues` merges heterogeneous config objects |
| `tabTxHistory.tsx` ×1 | `.filter((tx: any)` | `biome-ignore` — `TransactionFromNode` is a wide discriminated union |
| `Copy.tsx` ×4 | `ReactElement<any>` | `biome-ignore` — `cloneElement` wrapper requires `any` to access `.props` dynamically |
| `Tabs.tsx` ×2 | `ReactElement<any>` | `biome-ignore` — same cloneElement pattern |
| `DropdownButton.tsx` ×1 | `ReactElement<any>` | `biome-ignore` — same cloneElement pattern |

**Config change**: global `"noExplicitAny": "off"` deleted from `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json` `suspicious` rules. Test file override block still has `"off"`.

### exchange biome.json rule promotions

| Rule | Scope | Violations found | Action |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `noNonNullAssertion` | production `style` | **0** | Promoted to `"error"` in `apps/exchange/biome.json` |
| `noExplicitAny` | production `suspicious` | **1** (`lib/forms.ts` zodResolver bridge — pre-existing `biome-ignore`) | Promoted to `"error"`; existing suppression valid |

### exchange vite.config.ts — Sentry chunk placement

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `apps/exchange/vite.config.ts` | Added `@sentry/ → 'sentry'` to `manualChunks` | Sentry was co-located with `Leasing-*.js` (lazy route); error capture was deferred until `/wallet/leasing` navigation. Dedicated chunk ensures startup-time error capture. |

## Already Fixed — Round 18

| Item | File | Fix Applied |
|------|------|-------------|
| `it.todo` invoke default-function (stale "needs fixture update" comment) | `packages/transactions/test/transactions/invoke-script.spec.ts` | Replaced `it.todo` with passing test asserting `tx.call === null`, `tx.dApp`, `tx.type === 16`; 344 tests, 0 todos |

## Already Fixed — Round 16

| Item | File | Fix Applied |
|------|------|-------------|
| HIGH CVE `path-to-regexp@0.1.12` (GHSA-37ch-88jc-xwx2 ReDoS) | root `package.json` | Added `"path-to-regexp": ">=0.1.13"` to `pnpm.overrides`; `pnpm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities |
| nx + @nx/devkit 22.6.2 → 22.6.3 | root `package.json` | Patch bump |

| @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb 6.32.0 → 6.33.0 | `apps/cubensis-connect/package.json` | Patch bump |
| Stale `noExplicitAny: off` for VaultController.ts | `apps/cubensis-connect/biome.json` | Removed — file has 0 actual `any` annotations; rule now active |
| Stale `react19-compat.d.ts` knip ignore | `knip.json` | Removed — file was deleted in Round 15 |
| QRCode `as unknown as React.ComponentType` cast ×5 | `QRCode.tsx` + 3 consumers | Centralized cast as named exports in `QRCode.tsx`; consumers import typed component |
| `console.log` in TransactionConfirmationFlow.tsx JSDoc | `apps/exchange/src/components/wallet/TransactionConfirmationFlow.tsx` | Replaced with `logger.info()` |

## Already Fixed — Round 13

| Item | File | Fix Applied |
|------|------|-------------|
| `tsdown` catalog gap | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Bumped `0.21.5 → 0.21.6` |
| Exchange Vite inconsistency | `apps/exchange/package.json` | Bumped `^8.0.2 → ^8.0.3` |
| ARCHITECTURE.md TypeScript version | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Updated `5.9.x → 6.0.x` and code example |
| Exchange 6.2 MB main bundle | `apps/exchange/src/routes/*.tsx` | Converted `dexRoutes`, `settingsRoutes`, `walletRoutes` from static to React Router v7 `lazy()` — critical-path bundle reduced from **6.2 MB → 3.5 MB** (-43%). `Dex-*.js` 63 kB, `SettingsPage-*.js` 27 kB, `LeasingModern-*.js` lazy. `victory` library (2.5 MB) deferred to `Leasing-*.js` lazy chunk, loads only on `/wallet/leasing` navigation. |

## Already Fixed — Round 14

| Item | File | Fix Applied |
|------|------|-------------|
| TypeScript enums → `const` objects | `apps/exchange/src/**` | 5 enums migrated; `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` enabled |
