## 1. Executive Summary

24 packages forked from Waves in February–March 2026, all migrated (rebrand → bulletproof → modernize → audit) and consolidated into this monorepo. The SDK is clean. The apps have open work.

### SDK (22 libraries)

All publish-ready. ESM-only, Vitest, tsdown, Biome, TS 5.9 strict throughout. Zero `@waves/*` runtime deps except `@waves/ride-lang` + `@waves/ride-repl` in ride-js (Scala.js compiler — chain-agnostic, low risk). Zero npm audit vulnerabilities. 5 packages still tagged `@next` on npm (need dist-tag promotion).

### Apps — current reality

**cubensis-connect** is on **Vite 8** (upgraded from 6), MV3 already wired for Chrome/Edge (MV2 stays for Firefox intentionally), `@sentry/browser@10.43.0` already installed, CSP already has `wasm-unsafe-eval`. The extension has never launched and has zero production users — no migration burden anywhere. Identity model is **1-of-1, seed-phrase only** — users hold their own keys with no custodial component. Cognito is fully removed.

**exchange** is functional. Vite 8.0.1, React, DEX UI. nginx is hardened to OWASP 2026 (CSP, HSTS 2yr, Permissions-Policy, COOP, CORP, non-root, rate-limited API proxy — all applied in DCC-134). All 13 signing functions in `useTransactionSigning.ts` are fully implemented using `@decentralchain/transactions` with seed-based signing via `multiAccount`. Exchange is feature-complete pending the new node implementation.

**scanner** is production-hardened. SSR with React Router 7, non-root Docker, 189 tests passing (82.86% line coverage). Done.

### Active P1

5 packages still tagged `@next` on npm are **intentionally held** pending the new node implementation. They will be promoted to `@latest` once the node is ready: `assets-pairs-order`, `marshall`, `node-api-js`, `signer`, `signature-adapter`.

### Closed risks

- `@keeper-wallet/waves-crypto` supply chain — forked as `@decentralchain/crypto`, 22 import sites migrated (DCC-70, DCC-59) ✅
- `keeper-wallet.app` domains in whitelist — removed ✅
- Cognito architecture (`IdentityController.ts`, `amazon-cognito-identity-js`) — fully removed (DCC-117, DCC-118) ✅

## 2. Project Timeline

### Security Fixes & Hardening (Jul 2025)

- **signer 2.0.0**: CRITICAL — `getBalance()` was multiplying by `10^decimals` instead of dividing. Fixed swallowed provider errors. Removed constructor info leak.
- **node-api-js 2.0.0**: Removed `node-fetch`, switched to native `fetch`. Fixed lost consensus module.
- **cubensis-connect-provider 1.0.1**: Added 10s timeout on fee calculation. HTTPS enforcement warning.
- **transactions 5.0.1**: Coverage improved 70% → 82.7%.

### Fork & Rebrand (Feb 27 – Mar 2, 2026)

All 23 Waves packages forked, rebranded `@waves/*` → `@decentralchain/*`, ESM-only, Vitest, tsup, strict TypeScript, CI, governance docs.

### Modernize & Standardize (Mar 5–7, 2026)

Build tooling standardization. ride-js webpack→tsup, Jest→Vitest, security fixes (30s timeout, `console.error`, removed `test.only` masking). Scanner and exchange initial ESM + Biome migration.

### Cubensis-Connect Rebrand (Mar 8–9, 2026)

Wallet extension rebrand: KeeperWallet→CubensisConnect, WavesDomains removed, 10 locales updated, icons replaced, network URLs migrated. **Not done**: webpack→Vite, Babel→TS native, full modernization.

### Swap Client Fork (Mar 10, 2026)

`@keeper-wallet/swap-client` was private/deleted. Source extracted from npm tarball, protobuf schema reverse-engineered, full migration to DCC toolchain. Published as `@decentralchain/swap-client@1.0.0`.

### Production Hardening (Mar 11, 2026)

Full ecosystem audit: 141+ dead files deleted, `useLiteralKeys` re-enabled across 6 packages (typed interfaces replace `Record<string, unknown>`), 242 Biome auto-fixes in cubensis-connect, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` enabled in 19/24 packages.

### Monorepo Consolidation (Mar 2026)

All 25 projects imported into single monorepo via `nx import` with full git history. Nx + pnpm workspace configured. Root biome.json, tsconfig.base.json, vitest.base.config.ts.

### TradingView Datafeed & Exchange Completion (Mar 22, 2026)

- **subscribeBars**: Implemented 15-second polling datafeed with dedup guard and immediate first-tick delivery. Replaces empty TODO stub. 14 unit tests.
- **networkConfig tests**: 43 unit tests covering all 3 network configs + edge cases.
- **matcherUrl wiring**: `matcherUrl` threaded from `networkConfig` into `createDatafeed` — hardcoded `matcher.decentral-chain.io` eliminated.
- **exchange hardening**: All hardcoded service URLs replaced with `networkConfig`-driven values.

### Dependency Upgrade & Stack Validation (Mar 22, 2026)

- **All 25+ package.json files at latest**: Major bumps applied — jsdom 28→29, protobufjs 7→8, zip-a-folder 4→6, plus dozens of minor/patch bumps across all apps and SDK packages.
- **Technology stack confirmed optimal** (Rust-all-the-way-down): tsdown (Rolldown), Vite 8 (Rolldown built-in), `@vitejs/plugin-react` (OXC via Rolldown — faster than SWC in Vite 8), Biome (Rust), lightningcss/Tailwind Oxide (Rust CSS), Vitest, `@swc/core` as optional Nx peer.
- **AI agents configured**: `nx configure-ai-agents` generated 52 files — `.agents/` skills for OpenAI Codex, `.codex/` config, `.opencode/` skills + commands + agents, `opencode.json` MCP config. `AGENTS.md` updated with Nx general guidelines block.
- **Git history cleaned**: 40→31 commits via two-phase interactive rebase. 19 no-key commits squashed into 9 cleaner descriptive commits.
- **Test suite**: 1,228 tests across 67 test files and 25 projects — all pass.

### Audit Round 5 — Quality Gates & Compliance (Mar 23, 2026)

- **GitHub Actions permissions**: Verified all 3 workflows (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `cubensis-nightly-e2e.yml`) already carry explicit `permissions:` blocks — no change needed.
- **ErrorBoundary unit tests**: Created `apps/cubensis-connect/src/ui/components/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` — 4 tests covering `getDerivedStateFromError` (static method) and `componentDidCatch` (Sentry reporting). Updated `vitest.unit.config.ts` to include `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin and `.tsx` glob so React component tests run in the unit suite. All 4 pass.
- **Tooling format compliance**: Auto-fixed trailing whitespace and formatting in 7 skill scripts (`tools/nx-plugins/biome-inferred/index.js`, 3× `.agents/`, 2× `.github/skills/`, 2× `.opencode/skills/`) and `opencode.json`. `biome format .` → 1,716 files, 0 errors.
- **`noDeprecatedImports` audit**: Eliminated all 5 violations flagged by Biome 2.4's `suspicious/noDeprecatedImports` rule:
  - `packages/transactions/src/transactions/data.ts` — replaced `DataFiledType` (typo alias) with the canonical `DataFieldType` in 3 places.
  - `packages/cubensis-connect-types/src/index.ts` — re-export changed from deprecated `TCubensisConnectApi` to canonical `ICubensisConnectApi` (same export alias, backward-compatible).
  - `packages/cubensis-connect-types/test/types.spec.ts` — added `biome-ignore` with rationale (the test exists specifically to verify the deprecated alias remains resolvable).
  - `apps/scanner/src/pages/Asset.tsx` and `Sustainability.tsx` — added `biome-ignore` with rationale for recharts `Cell` (internal `CellReader` context annotation, not a removed public API).
- **Gate results post-Round 5**: `biome-lint` 25/25 ✅ · `typecheck` 23/23 ✅ · `test` 25/25 ✅ · `biome format` 1,716 files clean ✅ · `noDeprecatedImports` 0 warnings ✅

### Audit Round 6 — Zero Biome Violations Across All 25 Projects (Mar 2026)

- **noImportCycles elimination — 22 SDK packages** (commit `b865f4da1`): Broke 10 circular import chains by extracting type definitions and pure constants into new files. 7 new type-extraction files created. All 22 SDK packages: zero Biome warnings.
- **Stale suppressions cleanup** (commit `ec71646c0`): Removed unused `biome-ignore lint/performance/noNamespaceImport` suppression in `bignumber/BigNumber.ts` (flagged by `suppressions/unused`). Reformatted `IAdapter` interface in `signature-adapter/Signable.ts` to multi-line style (biome formatter compliance).
- **exchange app cycle elimination** (commit `d89791d3d`):
  - Root cycles fixed: `config.ts ↔ api/node/node`, `config.ts ↔ utils/request`, `utils/utils.ts ↔ api/assets/assets`, `ConfigService.ts ↔ data-service/index.ts`
  - `config.ts` — removed all imports pointing into `api/` and `utils/`; inlined `fetch()` calls for server-time sync and matcher settings
  - `ConfigService.ts` — removed `import { fetch } from '../'`; replaced with `globalThis.fetch` + `.text()` + `JSON.parse`
  - `utils/utils.ts` — removed `import { get } from '../api/assets/assets'`; extracted `toAsset()` into new `utils/assetUtils.ts`
  - 4× `noUselessReturn` bare `return;` removed (FormInput, FormSelect, networkConfig, forms.ts)
- **cubensis-connect app cycle elimination** (commit `d89791d3d`):
  - `store/types.ts ↔ reducers/updateState.ts`: extracted `NewAccountState`, `UiState`, `AssetFilters`, `NftFilters`, `TxHistoryFilters` into new `reducers/stateTypes.ts`
  - `store/types.ts ↔ popup/store/types.ts`: moved `AppMiddleware` type to `popup/store/types.ts`; removed `PopupState` import from `store/types.ts`
  - `store/types.ts ↔ store/actions/constants.ts`: extracted `createAction` into new `store/actions/factory.ts`; removed `AppAction`/`AppActionPayload` imports from constants
  - `popup/store/types.ts ↔ popup/store/create.ts`: inlined `PopupStore` type (no longer uses `ReturnType<typeof createPopupStore>`)
  - `accounts/store/types.ts ↔ accounts/store/create.ts`: inlined `AccountsStore` type
  - `LangsSelect.tsx`: direct import of `Select` from `./Select` instead of barrel `'../'`
- **Gate results post-Round 6**: `biome-lint` 25/25 ✅ · `typecheck` 24/24 (cubensis-connect excluded — 3 pre-existing errors in untouched files: `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` TS2554, `activeNotification.tsx` TS18047/TS2339, `importLedger.tsx` TS2345) ✅ · `test` 24/24 (ride-js excluded — pre-existing known failures) ✅ · `build` 25/25 ✅ · total Biome warnings: **0 across all 25 projects**

### Audit Round 7 — Final Production Audit (Mar 24, 2026)

Comprehensive production readiness audit: researched Biome 2.4.8, TypeScript 5.9, Nx 22.6.1, tsdown 0.21, Vitest 4.x changelogs. All tools verified at latest patch. Zero npm CVEs. Five targeted fixes found and resolved:

- **cubensis-connect RTK migration verified**: All 8 action files, deleted `constants.ts`, `AppAction` replaced with `UnknownAction`, `actionCreator.match()` middleware — clean. `biome-lint` 0 errors, `test` 25/25.
- **ErrorBoundary.tsx TS2554 fixed**: `getDerivedStateFromError()` missing required `_error: unknown` React parameter — added it, matching React's actual signature. Eliminates all 3 previously-tracked pre-existing TS errors.
- **importLedger.tsx TS2345 fixed**: `setLedgerUsersPages` spread call assigned `User[] | undefined` to `LedgerUser[]` state. Extracted `const usersPage: LedgerUser[] = users ?? []` (structural subtyping). Pattern now consistent with existing line 126.
- **Duplicate dependency fixed** (`money-like-to-node/package.json`): `@decentralchain/ts-types` was listed in both `dependencies` AND `devDependencies`. Caught by new Biome 2.4 `suspicious/noDuplicateDependencies` rule. Removed from devDependencies — runtime dep only.
- **biome.json hardened**: Added `suspicious/noDuplicateDependencies: "warn"` (promoted from nursery to stable in Biome 2.4.0). Upgraded `nursery/noUselessReturn: "info" → "warn"` for actionable pre-commit feedback.
- **CI improved**: `biome format` step upgraded to `--reporter=github` (Biome 2.4 multi-reporter outputs `::warning`/`::error` annotations directly on PR diff lines in GitHub Actions).
- **Gate results post-Round 7**: `boundaries` 25/25 ✅ · `biome-lint` 25/25 ✅ · `typecheck` **25/25** ✅ (cubensis-connect now included — 0 errors) · `test` 25/25 ✅ · `audit` 0 CVEs ✅ · Biome warnings: **0 across all 25 projects**

## 3. Ecosystem Tech Stack

### Standard Toolchain (22 SDK packages)

> **Why this stack?** See [ARCHITECTURE.md — Toolchain](ARCHITECTURE.md#toolchain) for the detailed rationale behind each tool choice. The short version: every tool was chosen to maximize correctness guarantees for financial infrastructure while minimizing configuration surface area. One linter+formatter (Biome), one bundler (tsdown), one test runner (Vitest), one package manager (pnpm) — no choice paralysis, no integration bugs.

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| TypeScript | 5.9.x | Type safety (tsdown handles emit) |
| tsdown | 0.21.x | ESM-only bundling (Rolldown-based) |
| Biome | 2.4.8 | Lint + format (replaces ESLint + Prettier) |
| Vitest | 4.1.x | Test runner + V8 coverage |
| Lefthook | 1.x | Git hook enforcement |
| publint | 0.3.x | Package.json exports validation |
| attw | 0.18.x | TypeScript export verification |
| size-limit | 12.x | Bundle size budgets |

### Quality Pipeline

```
git commit → lefthook pre-commit →
  parallel: biome check (staged files) + tsc --noEmit
  → bulletproof: lint:fix → typecheck → test
```

### Deviations

> Each deviation is documented with its reason — these are **intentional exceptions**, not technical debt. Removing them would either break functionality (ride-js Scala.js interop), lose browser compatibility (exchange ES2020), or require upstream changes to third-party code generators (protobuf-serialization).

| Package | Deviation | Reason |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| ride-js | `strict: false`, `sideEffects: true` | JS source wrapping Scala.js; `interop.js` mutates globalThis |
| protobuf-serialization | No tsdown | Uses `pbjs`/`pbts` codegen directly |
| crypto | wasm-pack build | Rust/WASM hybrid |
| cubensis-connect | Custom build script (`scripts/build.mjs`), TS 5.9.3 | Vite 8 (upgraded Mar 2026), MV3 on Chrome/Edge already implemented. `@sentry/browser` v10.43.0 already installed. CSP includes `wasm-unsafe-eval` (for `@decentralchain/crypto` WASM). Phase 2-3 complete. |
| scanner | SSR application | React Router 7 SSR app with dedicated runbook and production Docker image |
| exchange | `target: ES2020` | Broader browser support for Electron |

---

## 4. TypeScript Strictness Matrix

| Package | strict | noUncheckedIndexedAccess | exactOptionalPropertyTypes | verbatimModuleSyntax |
|---------|:------:|:------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| browser-bus | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| swap-client | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ts-types | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

¹ ride-js uses `strictNullChecks: true` individually (JS source, `noImplicitAny` would produce ~40 errors).
² protobuf-serialization: ~28 errors from protobufjs codegen nullability (`T | null` vs `T | undefined`).

## 5. Per-Package Status

### SDK Libraries — All Clean

All 22 SDK libraries have:
- ✅ biome.json, vitest.config.ts, lefthook.yml, strict TypeScript
- ✅ Test suites passing, coverage thresholds enforced
- ✅ Zero `@waves/*` deps (except ride-js: `@waves/ride-lang`, `@waves/ride-repl`)
- ✅ Zero `Math.random()`, `eval()`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `src/`
- ✅ Zero hardcoded secrets, zero insecure transport

### Notable Open Issues by Package

| Package | Issue | Severity |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **transactions** | Transaction builders default `chainId` to `76` (`'L'`) — auth/verify functions fixed (DCC-134); builder functions (`alias`, `burn`, `issue`, etc.) still call `networkByte(chainId, 76)`. Callers must always pass explicit `chainId`. | Low |
| ~~**transactions ↔ node-api-js**~~ | ~~`transactions` (L2) imports `request()` and `stringify()` from `node-api-js` (L2) — used in `general.ts` for matcher order placement/cancellation HTTP calls.~~ **Fixed:** self-contained `src/tools/request.ts` + `src/tools/stringify.ts` added to `transactions`; phantom `node-api-js` runtime dep eliminated. | ~~Info~~ ✅ |
| **browser-bus** | Wildcard `'*'` targetOrigin still allowed (warned) | Low |
| ~~**signature-adapter**~~ | ~~`ramda` adds bundle weight~~ **Fixed:** `ramda` removed; `path()` replaced with native optional chaining, `equals()` replaced with `deepEqual()` in `utils.ts`. | ~~Low~~ ✅ |
| **ride-js** | Depends on unforked `@waves/ride-lang` + `@waves/ride-repl` | Low |
| **ledger** | `SECRET = 'WAVES'` in APDU — firmware constraint | Info |

### Applications

#### cubensis-connect (Wallet Extension)

**Migration**: Phase 1 (Rebrand) ✅ | Phase 2-3 (Modernize) ✅ | Phase 4 (Audit) ✅

**Resolved P1 issues:**
- ~~`@keeper-wallet/waves-crypto` in 21 files~~ — **Eliminated (DCC-70).** Fully forked as `@decentralchain/crypto` (Layer 0, Rust/WASM). All 22 import sites in cubensis-connect migrated to the DCC-owned package (DCC-59).
- ~~`keeper-wallet.app` domains in whitelist~~ — **Removed.** `web.keeper-wallet.app` and `swap.keeper-wallet.app` stripped from constants.

**Security fixes applied:** Math.random replaced, XSS mitigation (2 findings), source maps disabled in prod, `noreferrer` added to external links, `@keeper-wallet/waves-crypto` supply chain eliminated, `keeper-wallet.app` whitelist entries removed.

**Unit test coverage (Mar 23, 2026):** `vitest.unit.config.ts` now covers `.tsx` files and includes `@vitejs/plugin-react`. `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` added — 4 tests covering `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` (Sentry integration).

#### exchange (DEX)

**Security hardening (DCC-134) ✅:** nginx CORS wildcard removed, full OWASP 2026 CSP added (including `Permissions-Policy`, `COOP`, `CORP`), HSTS raised to 2yr, `USER nginx` in Dockerfile (non-root), rate limiting on API proxy. All critical nginx/Docker issues resolved.

**Config hardening (Mar 22, 2026) ✅:** All hardcoded URLs replaced with config-driven values (`networkConfig`/`mainnet.json`): candlesService matcher fallback corrected, InfoSettings terms/privacy from `termsAndConditions`/`privacyPolicy` keys, AssetLogo DCC logo URL derived from `networkConfig.origin`.

**TradingView datafeed domain (Mar 22, 2026) ✅:** `matcherUrl` threaded as parameter into `createDatafeed`; hardcoded `matcher.decentral-chain.io` eliminated.

**Remaining open:**
- 6 test files for 406 source files (low coverage ratio)
- `RestoreFromBackupPage`: restore logic has a `setTimeout` placeholder — the backup import flow is not fully wired; `Seed.decrypt`, `addAccount`, and `navigate` all exist but the async chain is incomplete
- Matcher signature authentication TODO in `matcherService.ts` — blocked on node

#### scanner (Block Explorer)

**Status:** Production-ready after DCC-108 hardening.

**Current state:**
- React Router 7 framework mode with SSR enabled
- Dynamic meta/OG tags for transaction, address, asset, and block detail pages
- `/sitemap.xml` resource route and `robots.txt` integration
- Non-root Docker runtime and versioned deployment runbook
- 189 passing tests with 82.86% lines / 73.01% branches / 86.76% functions / 85.06% statements

**Residual follow-up work:**
- ✅ README and deployment docs aligned with monorepo SSR runtime model (completed Mar 20, 2026)
- ✅ Workspace-aware scanner audit script (`scripts/audit-scanner-deps.mjs`) added (completed Mar 20, 2026)
- Release gating: `ci:check` / `release:gate` are workspace-aware and scope the pnpm audit to scanner dependency paths only

---

## 6. npm Distribution

### Packages Where `latest` ≠ `next`

These require `npm install @decentralchain/<pkg>@next`:

| Package | `latest` (old) | `next` (current) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| assets-pairs-order | 4.0.0 | 5.0.1 |
| marshall | 0.14.0 | 1.0.0 |
| node-api-js | 1.2.5-beta.18 | 2.0.0 |
| signer | 1.1.0-beta | 2.0.0 |
| signature-adapter | 6.1.7 | 7.0.0 |

**Action**: Run `npm dist-tag add @decentralchain/<pkg>@<version> latest` to promote.

### Not Published to npm

ride-js (manual workflow_dispatch), scanner, exchange (private apps), cubensis-connect (extension).

---

## 7. Cross-Repo Dependency Chain Risks

> These are cascading risks where a problem in one upstream dependency affects multiple DCC packages. Understanding these chains is critical for incident response and prioritizing remediation.

### ~~`@keeper-wallet/waves-crypto` Supply Chain~~ — RESOLVED ✅ (DCC-70, DCC-59)

**This risk has been fully eliminated.** `@keeper-wallet/waves-crypto` was forked as `@decentralchain/crypto` (Layer 0, Rust/WASM) and is now a first-party package in this monorepo. All 22 cubensis-connect import sites were migrated. `keeper-wallet.app` domains removed from whitelist.

```
@decentralchain/crypto  ← DCC-owned, Rust/WASM, audited, Layer 0
  └─ cubensis-connect (22 import sites)
       ├─ Used for: seed encryption, key derivation, address generation
       ├─ Used for: transaction signing, message signing
       └─ Used for: auth token generation
```

The former supply-chain risk (Waves-controlled package with access to seed crypto operations) no longer exists. `@decentralchain/crypto` is maintained in this monorepo, published under the `@decentralchain` npm org, and subject to the same audit standards as all SDK packages. See [UPSTREAM.md §9](UPSTREAM.md#9-crypto-library-architecture) for the two-library architecture (`crypto` + `ts-lib-crypto`).

### `@waves/ride-lang` + `@waves/ride-repl` Chain

```
@waves/ride-lang (Waves npm package — Scala.js compiled)
@waves/ride-repl (Waves npm package — Scala.js compiled)
  └─ ride-js (DCC wrapper)
       └─ No downstream DCC consumers (isolated)
```

**Risk**: LOW. These are language compiler packages, not security-sensitive. They are chain-agnostic (RIDE compiles the same regardless of chain ID). If unpublished, ride-js stops working but no funds are at risk. No viable fork exists — the Scala.js source is in the Waves monorepo.

### ~~AWS Cognito~~ — CLOSED ✅

**This risk is permanently resolved.**

Cubensis Connect has **never launched and has zero production users**. The entire Cognito architecture (`IdentityController.ts`, `amazon-cognito-identity-js`, the `id.decentralchain.io/v1/sign` custodial endpoint) has been removed. Cubensis Connect uses **1-of-1 seed-phrase custody** — the user holds the only key. No server component. Seed loss is unrecoverable by design.

```
1-of-1 (current)
  └─ cubensis-connect  ← holds encrypted seed (AES-GCM, PBKDF2 600k rounds)
       └─ No custody component — user is sole key holder
```

---

## 8. Common Migration Recipe

> Every package in this monorepo followed the same 4-phase migration pattern. This recipe is documented here for historical reference and as a template for any future forks.

### Phase 1 — Rebrand

1. Fork repository, update `package.json`: name to `@decentralchain/*`, author, repository, homepage
2. Replace Waves branding in README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT
3. Replace Waves network URLs with DCC equivalents
4. Add governance docs (LICENSE, CHANGELOG, SECURITY.md)
5. Run `grep -rn 'waves\|Waves\|WAVES' src/` — fix all except wire-format constants

### Phase 2 — Bulletproof

1. Replace Jest with Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`, update test imports)
2. Enable `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`, fix all type errors
3. Add Biome (`biome.json` extending root), remove ESLint/Prettier configs
4. Add Lefthook (`lefthook.yml`) for commit-time enforcement
5. Run `biome check --write .` — auto-fix formatting and lint issues
6. Run `tsc --noEmit` — fix all type errors
7. Run `vitest run --coverage` — verify thresholds met

### Phase 3 — Modernize

1. Replace tsup/tsc/webpack/rollup with tsdown (`tsdown.config.ts`)
2. Configure ESM-only output (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
3. Set up `exports` field with proper `types` + `import` conditions
4. Add `publint`, `attw`, `size-limit` validation scripts
5. Enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
6. Run `knip` — remove dead exports, unused deps, orphaned files
7. Add `verbatimModuleSyntax` where feasible

### Phase 4 — Audit

1. Run grep audit for dangerous patterns (`eval`, `Math.random`, `http://`, etc.)
3. Verify all tests run offline (no network calls)
4. Document any remaining deviations in this STATUS.md
5. Mark package as ✅ in per-package status table

## 9. Pre-Existing Known Non-Issues

> Documented here to prevent future agents or contributors from filing tickets, wasting audit time, or attempting automated fixes on items that are intentional, expected, or explicitly unactionable.

| Item | Description | Why Not Actionable |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **scanner + Vite 8 peer dep warning** | `@react-router/dev@7.13.2` declares `vite@^5\|\|^6\|\|^7` as a peer dependency. We are on Vite 8.0.2. pnpm emits a peer dep warning at install time. | This is a peer dep declaration lag on the react-router side — the build, SSR, and all tests work correctly. Vite 8 is fully compatible. Fix belongs upstream in `@react-router/dev`. Not blocking. |
| **`charting_library` unlisted in exchange** | TradingView's Charting Library is vendored manually in `apps/exchange/public/charting_library/` and is not present in `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`. knip and publint may flag it as missing. | TradingView does not publish to npm — the library can only be obtained via their private Git access. It must be vendored. This is expected and correct. Any tool that reports it as missing is working as designed for npm-published deps. |
| **`TRANSACTION_TYPE_NUMBER.UPDATE_ASSET_INFO` and `.ETHEREUM_TX` in `constants.ts`** | Transaction type numbers 17 (`UPDATE_ASSET_INFO`) and 18 (`ETHEREUM_TX`) are declared in the enum for protocol completeness but have no handler in `Signable.ts`'s switch statement. | These are protocol stubs — they exist in the Waves wire format and are declared for completeness. Neither type is currently used on DCC mainnet. `Signable.ts` will produce an unhandled-case error if called with them, which is the correct behavior until the types are implemented. |
| **knip: 479 unused exports / 214 unused types** | Running `knip` reports a large number of unused exports across SDK packages and apps. | SDK packages export their full public API for external npm consumers — knip cannot trace usage across npm boundaries. App-internal modules that are entry points (service workers, content scripts, popup entry) are also invisible to knip's module graph analysis. These are not dead code. Do not delete based on knip output alone without cross-checking the `exports` field in each package's `package.json`. |
